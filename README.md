# Movies-Repo

This project concerns the creation of a sort of manager of the movies stored in your device.
One can "add movies" by adding:
1) Title;
2) Plot;
3) Genre;
4) Year;
5) Main Actors;
6) YES/NO if you have watched it;

The program automatically creates a collection of actors once it has read all the movies stored.

There are lots of functionality to display all the movies stored:

* Show movies alphabetically ordered;
* Show movies by year of production;
* Search movie by name;
* Search movies by actor;
* Search movies by year of production;
* Search movies by genre;
* Extract random movie;
* Extract random movie by genre;
* Extract random movie from -Not Watched Ones- ;
* Show Statistics : How many movies there are, how many watched movies;
 
 Moreover, one can add some addenda in order to display more features of the movies, for example, 
 by default only the title of the movies are displayed, but one can also choose to display the year
 of production, the actors, the plot and if it has already been watched (and clearly every combination
 of these).
